### What I learned

This was my second project for FrontendMentor. I completed the QR code a few days ago with a basic format. There were a few notes on the first project that I made sure to include or fix on this one, namely: adding a CSS reset, and using the <main> tag in my HTML. I was also more thorough with removing extra/unnecessary CSS declarations.

Since then, I have reached a point in the Udemy WebDev class where I have become more familiar with media queries and responsive design, so I decided to undertake a similar project that would allow me to add some of those features as well. It seemed those aspects went fairly well.

The things that I didn't notice initially were the active state image change and larger box-shadow on the desktop view. In regards to the image change- I did not know how to do this so I spent a bit of time diving into that and think I got it to a close approximation, although I realize that the active state color is not correct. I wasn't sure how to accomplish this. The second box-shadow I left off entirely for now.

### Continued development

I used this project to reinforce my CSS knowledge before jumping into utilizing BootStrap (as the course I am taking is pushing in that direction). My plan is to undertake a similar small project next, which will add BootStrap.
